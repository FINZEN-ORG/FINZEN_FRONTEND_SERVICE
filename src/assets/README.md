# Assets Folder

This folder contains all static assets used throughout the application.

## Structure
- **fonts/** - Custom fonts and typography files (.ttf, .otf)
- **images/** - Application images, logos, and graphics (.png, .jpg, .svg)
- **icons/** - Small UI icons and interface elements

## Usage
- Import images: `require('../../assets/images/logo.png')`
- Fonts are automatically linked via react-native-asset
- Keep assets organized by type for better maintainability

## Best Practices
- Use descriptive filenames
- Optimize images for mobile (webp recommended)
- Include @2x and @3x versions for different screen densities
- Keep file sizes minimal for better app performance

## Current Assets
- **FinZen Logo**: The main application logo
- **Forque Font Family**: Custom typography for enhanced branding
